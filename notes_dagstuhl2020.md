# Mass Spec Coding Standards

These notes summarise a discussion held at the [Dagstuhl seminar *Computational Metabolomics: From Cheminformatics to Machine Learning*](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=20051).

**Participants**: Laurent Gatto (UCLouvain, Belgium), Ewy Mathé (Ohio State University – Columbus, US), Pieter Dorrestein (University of California – San Diego, US), Egon Willighagen (Maastricht University, NL), Oscar Yanes (Rovira i Virgili University – Reus, ES).

### Abstract

During this discussion about guidelines on how to share code related to computational mass spectrometry, we decided to remain programming language agnostic, and focus on community-level goals. It was highlighted that for such contributions to be helpful, they needed to contain software or code, and at least some testing data and documentation. The extend and "quality" of these, especially the latter, should however be regarded as flexible for two main reasons. The first one being that less seasoned contributors shouldn't be barred from disseminating their work due to arbitrarily strict requirements. Second, there is a difference between publishing a method or a (computational) solution to a specific problem and a "finished" software product, and it is important to appreciate the value (novelty or engineering quality, for example) of both of these outputs. Hence the importance for these guidelines to emanate from the community at large to enable/facilitate important goals, and should not become rigid requirements. 

We have identified three important end goals that should be highlighted when contributing and disseminating code, namely (1) reproducibility, (2) usability and (3) learnability. Each of these will require code, documentation and test data, albeit to different extents. In some cases, small test data and a README file will suffice to install and reproduce some scripts implementing a novel method. On the other hand, finalised software products will have to provide more in-depth documentation (function-, software-level documentation, how-to's, ...)  and comply with additional (language-specific) software requirements. Hence, the importance for the contributors to accurately describe the type and scope of the code deliverables they share with the community.
