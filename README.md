# Guidelines for publication of code related to mass spectrometry data analysis

[Ronald Beavis](https://twitter.com/NorSivaeb) and [Conor C Jenkins](https://twitter.com/SpecInformatics) had a [discussion](https://twitter.com/NorSivaeb/status/1198997977496342528?s=20) about developing some guidelines for publication of code related to mass spectrometry data analysis. Ronald and I spoke about getting started with some examples of tools coded in some of the most popular languages utilized to start off (python, R, C++, and C#). This discussion lead to the creation of a [slack group](https://t.co/uab4TPfzHp?amp=1) and this repository. 

The idea is to define some principles, and to illustrate these using different programming languages and MS-related tools, to eventually define some best practice for the wider community.
